> [!Bible] [Romans 7:9 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+7:9?translation=kjv)
> 9. For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.

This was the period in which I thought my biggest problem was that I had no problems. I stole money from my brother to buy Legos, and I cheated in school from 4th grade onward, but I had no puncture in my conscience. I didn't know the commandments of God, and so I didn't understand sin.
