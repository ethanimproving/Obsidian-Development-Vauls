God, I don’t know what love is, and how could I? You crafted women so that man would not have to be alone, but what good is a snare, a woman whose heart is a trap? “I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all.” My heart has been captive to women before, but it only served to show me what love isn’t. For six years an illusion of love captured me, until another turned my interest to herself. But neither one of them turned me from evil. Until another came, but only a reflection of my past. Her beauty was pure, like that of an angel, her eyes gleamed brighter than jewels, and her smile outshined the sun. Her hair was like a flowing river, and her skin as pure as light. Joy and happiness was written on her face, the same as it was in my memory. But I was afraid to love her, for I had been fooled before, when my heart told me that I loved the two before her. But unlike the other two, her beauty took my heart away from corruption. No longer did adulteress fantasies burden me; lust was nowhere to be found. And this is why I ask, oh Lord, does your servant finally know love? But surely I don’t know love, when I consider what love is;“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always preserves.” – 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. Surely I am all of these things with her, and yet none of them. For all I know of her is a memory, and perhaps, a memory is now all that exists. I’ve seen her, but I haven’t met with her. Perhaps the purity in her eyes is only an illusion, but let me at least find out. Just let me see her once more, so that I won’t go on with wonder.
