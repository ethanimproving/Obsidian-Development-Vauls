I was adding New IFB sermons to [the TVDB](https://thetvdb.com/series/345404-show) and learned a macro to download YouTube Playlists and automatically name them according to its index so that people can easily add the series to Plex and not have to worry about metadata.  

I also spent that month building Legos with Faith, even putting up a table in my room for it.
