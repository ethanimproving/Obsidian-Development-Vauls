And im going to Oklahoma with paul today most likely. That should be fun if I go. Either way today is going to be awesome!! Ah God is good! Whatever happens he’s with me and life is just awesome when I feel like this! Perfect temp and just feeling fresh hahaha! Whatever, I hope I can start going to bed early. That would be awesome! Dude I want to hang out with luke, I miss him but I remember a buch of stuff we did. I should write more in here and more stories that are actually funny but I’m too lazy lol. I’ve been having flash backs recently hahaha. And playing brawl and melee seem like the good old days HAHAHA! But I am soo happy right now and I don’t know why but I hope it stays cuz I’m usually tired. And I am NOT getting a gf HAHAHA!! I was just reading what I wrote last lol.
