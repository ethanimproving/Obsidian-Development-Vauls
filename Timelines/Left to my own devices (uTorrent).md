uTorrent: All the weights of the bag are his concern.  
The first evidence I have of using uTorrent was 12 Nov 2010 in a journal entry where I wrote, "Yeah so im trying to download men who stare at goats and it said it would take 50 days. Now it says 44 minutes hahaha." I'm offsetting it by a few months because it seems as though I already had a fair degree of experience with it to be torrenting with my cousin in Arkansas.  

The last thing I torrented would have been when I got caught for the second time and removed it from my laptop, and I remember it was Once Upon A Time that I was obtaining on the peer to peer system. I generally used the Pirate Bay, which shut down after a long while. Anyhow, the last episode I have from that series is "Dreamcatcher," which aired 25 Oct 2015, showing that I was torrenting content for at least 5 years.  

It made me feel useful because I was producing value without diminishing somebody else's goods. I didn't think of it as stealing, and in fact, I still don't. But it is piracy, and it's not right. Nevertheless I collected a large library of media to watch TV shows. There was a time when I burned the content to DVD's using DVD Flick, but then I learned how to stream it from my computer with a Plex server, and we began watching shows from it as a family. I worked really hard organizing and naming my libraries, and making sure all the metadata was correct and such. I still love database work, and now I know macros to automate the process.
