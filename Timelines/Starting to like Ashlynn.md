She is the shyest thing I've ever seen. She showed up while I was talking to the guys, and stood outside the crowd looking down. She's such a sweet girl when she talks to you, though. I actually like that she doesn't make eye contact because I'm sure that's the reason guys don't approach her. She really is extremely pretty, was home schooled for 4 years, and talks submissively, not domineeringly and loudly like many girls do to get attention. She is a Lutheran by descent, and I'll stay away from her if I can't get her saved.

But she is the prettiest girl I know right now, even surpassing Amy because of her humility. Her skin is a natural light tan with no imperfections, her hair is brown and soft as wool, and her body is fit and beautiful, taking the silhouette of an hourglass without defect. She always wears these terrible jeans very high, too high, competing with the height of her belly button. They are a boring light blue color, and it turns me on because she has no apologies for it. She's not pinned down by the wiles of fashion. She's not of this world, and that causes me to take interest in her.

There are some girls who need people to validate them, doing whatever it takes to please whoever they covet esteem from. There are other girls who need people who know that they don't care what you think. They need you to think that, and it's self-defeating. But it makes them loud and outgoing. But here is a girl who is not loud, and not a people-pleaser. She is a mystery to me. She doesn't dress herself in order to impress people, and she doesn't speak loudly in order to show people that she doesn't need their validation. Maybe she actually is content with such things as she has. Nevertheless, her shamefacedness is a virtue that is quick to win my affections.

When I walked inside the college, there was a girl making eye contact with me, looking down for only a second, and looked back up at me, so I said, "It's raining out." She smiled and playfully said, "Really? Thank you for telling me. I just straightened my hair!" I didn't bother to get her number, but I would have said, "You're very pretty. Are you single?" It's much easier for me to show interest in a girl right away, because if I wait 5 weeks, then the girl will think, "He's been interested in me for 5 weeks and it's taken him 5 weeks to gain the courage to talk to me. He sat by me week 2 and then just kept talking to the guys. What a slow, shy, wimp."
