This was at the top of the stairs by my mother, and in the witness of my sister Deborah. The gospel was not explained to me, neither the scriptures used to convert me, but I believed my mom when she said I would go to hell because of my disobedience unless I asked Jesus into my heart, and so I made the easiest choice of my life. I did not understand that salvation was paid for on the cross. I did not understand that salvation was a free gift. I did not understand that God hath given unto us eternal life, and this life is in his son. I wasn't saved. 

I make these assumptions on the basis of my writings later in life, when I denied eternal security, denied faith alone, and was discontented, believing that hell would be my home.
