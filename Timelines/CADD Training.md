The Lord will not give me this job. Lose your anxiety, Ethan. This is my rod. A forfeited opportunity because of my sin. Nevertheless, perhaps the Lord will be gracious with me. I will be as Jonathan and not Saul. I will work hard to get this job, and if the Lord be pleased, then I will have success, and if not, then I will be edified.  

I spent the month of February learning MicroStation to be a CADD Technician, learning the drawing tools, annotations, dimensioning, bridge components, I even learned VBA to create custom tools, and I got an interview, and I didn't get the job, and supposedly it was because I interjected him to much. He told Caleb I was annoying. So I was upset about that. And I thought, "Well, there are multiple kinds of value in the world, and the difference between a 30K salary and a 6 figure income is a matter of learning how to let technology work for us." <mark class="hltr-yellow">I decided just to catalog every good and service I've consumed in the last 20 years, figure out what makes it valuable, and calculate the value of every job that lies underneath the production process.</mark> So basically I'm not doing anything. Somebody needs to give me a swift kick in the butt and say, "Get to work."  

Technology is the difference between a farmer creating enough food for 10 people in the 1800's and 100 families now. And 1000 families 50 years from now once we start vertical farming techniques. Everybody produces a certain amount of value with their time, and there are ways we can do it more efficiently, and all it takes is technology and education.
