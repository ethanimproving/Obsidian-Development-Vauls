I used After Effects CS3 for the animation, FL Studio to mix the tracks, AE to animate the video, and HandBrake to reduce the file size after it's done rendering. Nexusfont came in handy in sorting through fonts, and X-Mouse was useful because my Microsoft mouse was incompatible with AE scrolling. If I was just clipping a video, I used Avidemux. I created a YouTube channel called "Amplify Ministries" that grew to 5,000 subscribers. Unfortunately it hosted the false teachers.
