I had spoken with her on Sunday and she friended me on Facebook Monday at noon to entice me to come to the potluck board game fellowship. I only briefly met her the week before when Ashley introduced us. She moved to Fort Worth for church over and against Arizona because she heard there were more single guys here, and there are many. Jacob Plant confessed to me on the day I met her that he doesn't really talk to the women in the church, as though wishing he had the courage. He also talks about Nexus, and I think he likes her, which makes me like her too.

I feel like Jacob and Nexus would make a better pair than the two of us, but something in my male nature wants to compete for her because I think that I can. He's afraid to talk to her, and I'm not afraid to talk to her, and that makes me alpha. I think I could win her. And I like her well enough to marry her, but I'm not committed to her in my heart as I have been with other girls. I'm not obsessed with her. I sort of just want to prove myself. I would be almost as happy to do some match making and send Jacob to go talk to Nexus. All he needs is someone to push him.
