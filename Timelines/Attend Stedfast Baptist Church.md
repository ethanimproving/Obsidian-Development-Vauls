This morning I felt like I was leaving everything I know. Tonight I feel like I'm coming back to a wasteland. All the activity, all the people, all of the lifeblood and energy is back in Fort Worth. I left a group of brothers in great fellowship and likeminded company, and I walked into my house to my family watching a reality TV show with brainwashing music. The Spirit in Fort Worth is amazing. The spirit here is dead. The spirit there is exciting and encouraging, and stimulating. There's nothing at home except a bed. It's quiet. I usually have a headache on Sunday afternoons as I take a nap. I put forth my hands to work for the Lord this afternoon and I feel great now.  

Pastor Shelley is a really great guy. His preaching is on par with Pastor Anderson's, and he's extremely humble. He greeted me no different than any of the brethren. Brother Jason from Garland, Brother Ryan, Brother Media dude, Brother Jacob from east Texas, Brother Jared (Jacob's brother), Brother Chris (Jacob's roomate, moved here in September from Michigan), Brother Canadian dude (also moved here in September), Brother Michael, Brother Elijah, Brother Ian, Brother Tony, Brother Steven. I love all the people there. Pastor Shelley was a software developer for a medical company. He told me he's a self-taught developer, and even created a curriculum for Elliot Ray to help him get an actual career. He was making something like 103K at his job. Who is my brother? And who is my mother? It truly is the spirit of comradery that I know at Stedfast. 

I'm motivated now more than ever to wake up early and learn React. With Pastor Shelley saying that it's a good career that's basically all about how hard you work, and you can get good pay if you work hard, I feel driven to show myself approved by my labor. He said it's like anything else, you have to be self-motivated to do it, and excel at it. He really was just a positive guy and full of life. Very upbeat and welcoming. I feel like I've known him for years. He just immediately treated me like a friend.
