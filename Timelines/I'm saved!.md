I was actually saved a few months before this date, but it was the morning of the day I determined to go soul-winning that I called upon the name of the Lord one final time, saying,  "Dear Jesus, I know I'm a sinner, I know I deserve to go to hell, But I believe that you died on the cross to pay for my sins ,And rose again, Please save my right now, And give me eternal life. I'm only trusting you, Jesus. Amen."
