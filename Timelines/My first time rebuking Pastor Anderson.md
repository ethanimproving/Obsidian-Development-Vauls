Pastor Anderson, 

I admire you vigor are straightforwardness. I find myself laboring very hard to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace when attempting to edify a Christian brother on this issue. It was kind of a relief to hear someone just go out and say what I often feel like saying. But I wonder if you're being diligent in the same fashion as Paul commands us in his epistle to the Ephesians.  
"I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."

I love your sermons, but it bothers that you don't preach according to the humility God calls us to (Micah 6:8). When I read the Bible I'm not sure I can find a sin God hates more than pride. It's been a real struggle for me, so I don't feel right trying to point out a speck in your eye with a log in my own. But I know that it grieves the Holy Spirit when we edify without gentleness, withholding grace from those who hear. 

"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption."  
Forgive me if I've misinterpreted something. I pray all the time that the Lord would protect me from error in hearing what the Holy Spirit is speaking through the pages of His Book, but I still prove to be immature in my walk time and time again. 

Grace with you, 

Ethan.﻿

Move along? Is that your philosophy for marriage too? I don't mean to be antagonistic, but Jesus prayed in John 17 "And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are." You see, there is a sort of "marriage" among believers, a spiritual oneness that transcends the oneness of the flesh. If "moving along" isn't the answer for those who are one only in this life (Matt. 22:30), how much less for those of us who are one for eternity? I care deeply about the brethren, and likewise the grief of the Spirit, so I just thought I would scatter some seed. 

Grace with you.﻿
