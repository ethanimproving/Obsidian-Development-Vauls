Dear Jennifer,  

I'm really going to miss you. You're making the right choice in giving Joshua a chance to be a husband to you and a father to Emma. Emma needs her daddy to be there for her.  
Don't be afraid to lean on Joshua. He let you down once, and it can be hard to trust him after that. But it's clear to me that he loves you. The problem is that he doesn't know how.  
Don't let him take you to the bedroom until you both have exchanged vows to one another. I don't know how far along you are in your Christian walk, but if your idea is to become independent so that you can leave him in case he becomes unsupportive again, you don't trust him. No relationship can survive without trust. If you want love, you have to take risks. He burned you once. You have to be willing to be burned again. That's what giving him another chance means.  
Two things you need to consider. He needs to be the spiritual leader of your home. I'm not saying this to filter him out. I'm saying this because I want you to bring him to me so that I can show him Christ. God will change his heart. God will empower him to be a good husband to you-- someone you can trust. If you can't trust him, don't go back to him. You haven't married him. You aren't bound. He led you into making a bad decision. That does NOT make you obligated to marry him.  
Love worketh no I'll to his neighbor.  

My heart hurts because of how you love Joshua. My heart is bulldozed whenever I see him call your phone.  

I am your biggest supporter. I want you to succeed. But not for the wrong reasons. The best career you can have is being a wife and a mother.  

Joshua is young. His life could take 1 of 2 directions. Either he is going to seek the Lord and become the kind of man you want to be married to, or he will seek his own pleasure and be difficult to live with. Don't make believe there is a middle ground. If he does not love God, he will not be a good father. More important than anthing is making sure Emma has a godly example to follow so that she will learn to have a relationship with Jesus. Joshua needs to be that example. And he can be. But give him time.  

I want you to be happy. I care about you no matter what. Show him trust and show him Christ.

You never knew it but your smile was the best part of working for Improving.  
You like a little bit of fire and spice. I can tell. Joshua can be rough at times, but at the end of the day you like it that way. You like that he can blow up sometimes. You like that he gets angry. I'm too patient for you. I'm too longsuffering. I'm too quick to forgive. I'm impossible to offend. Great peace have they which love thy law, and nothing shall offend them. I support you too unconditionally. You like it when Joshua tells you no. You disagreed with him and walked out because he made you angry, but you can't love someone that you can't be angry with. You can't love me because nothing I do or say will ever make you angry. I'm not enough of an adventure for you. I'm too easy. I'm too encouraging. I'm too sweet. I'm a nice guy. And when everything is over, you'll always choose Joshua. It's time for me to move on. We were never going to work anyway, but I'm going to miss you. I really liked seeing you every day. You made each work day bearable on my worst days and perfect on my best. I'm going to miss your smile. I'm going to miss your glances. I'm going to miss the way you walk into the room. But most of all I'm going to miss your chair scooted right next to mine. I'm going to miss you.  

I never told you this but the truth is that I love you. But I can see that you don't love me the same way. Don't worry about it. You were never obligated to.  

I never met anyone like you, and I don't expect to find another you. Your spirit was so gentle, so kind, so precious. I hope and pray that Joshua appreciates you, because you are one of a kind. There's no one like you. You are the best of them all.
