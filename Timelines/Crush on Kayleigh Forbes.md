If my memory serves me correctly from yesterday, I asked God to put truth in my mind, I was feeling somewhat alone; hopeless of Eros. But I barely mentioned it in a metaphor that his plan for me be fulfilled, that the empty replacements I tried loving would stop. 

First off I want to make known that I’ve “loved” 2 people in a form I thought was serious. The first was Savannah Calvert; I was fascinated with her for years. I tried leaving my obsession with her behind, but it wouldn’t go away, until it was replaced by a girl named Kayleigh Forbes at the mention of my cousin Paul. During a text message she came up and he asked if I was interested in her, when I at first responded no, he told me that I should be. Oddly enough that’s when my fascination with Savannah Calvert was replaced with Kayleigh Forbes.  
The only problem was she wasn’t actually the type of person I could carry on a conversation with. But as I pursued the idea I came to admire what I saw in her; God. 

Boyfriends came and went, but one finally stayed. A guy named Chandler Watkins. At first he was no threat to me, but one week turned into a month, and than half a year, and then 10 months, and it became apparent to me that I had missed my chance. So I finally decided to move on, and I did. At last the 15 cents she threw at me during camp was no longer by my bedside. Within the same moment I moved on, I asked God to replace her, as she replaced the first. 

Then I went on facebook and at the top of my newsfeed was a picture of a girl named Hannah Nixon, captioned “God didn't promise days without pain or sun without rain but he did promise strength for the day and light for the way!♥” Now I had never given much attention to her, but the beauty in the picture and the truth in her words captured my imagination. I thought maybe she could replace Kayleigh, and at first I found myself thinking about her a lot, but as the days grew older I lost interest. 

I became simply alone. For at this point, ironically enough, I was staying home from church, and avoiding people. I felt as if I had no friends, and in some ways, I didn’t. But when God pulled me out of my emptiness, he gave me passion, and reason to live, not for Eros, but for God. 

Later that day, I signed into Facebook, and at the top of my newsfeed, was Kayleigh Forbes, a status that read, “I don’t want to talk about it.” I felt excitement and ambition, considering the options. Maybe she was single again? But I didn’t want to stalk her and find out. I didn’t want to fall in the same “love” I had experienced before. Accepting the facts, that even if she was single, she wasn’t interested in me, I asked God for one thing… To place truth in my heart.
