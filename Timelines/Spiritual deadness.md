This period spans from the time I was condemned for the lusts of the eyes, being shown how exceedingly sinful sin is by Ray Comfort. I would spend the next 8 years trying to overcome pornography in order to obtain salvation. These were my dark ages, dark because of the ignorance that was in me, and dark because the depression that was in me. I contemplated gouging my eyes out, because that was more preferable than going to hell for all of eternity, but it seemed easier to just commit suicide to prevent further sinning, but that didn't seem like a viable option for getting into heaven. I couldn't live because my life was a living hell, and I couldn't die because I would go to hell.
