Brian came into my room and asked if I wanted an old broken down laptop to mess around with. I eagerly jumped at the chance and started playing with it. I plugged it in and turned it on, and saw that the screen was half cracked. But I could see just enough to get by. So I opened the unconnected internet browser, and got off. Then I opened notepad, and quickly wrote a song. That night Caleb was messing around with it as I was falling asleep, and I thought how cool it would be if I could get a new laptop and work on papers at night, and especially play Sim City, Roller Coaster Tycoon, 3D Home Architect, etc. So I was keeping an eye out for good deals, and about 6 months later, I bought my laptop (CQ60) for approximately 400 dollars. Before I set it up and placed it in my room, my Dad asked me, “Will you be a good boy?” and I assured him I would.
