I discovered hidden affections for Amy when I became sick with the flu one day and struggled to cease fantasizing about her. I found it a most absurd notion to be so fond of a girl so much older than me, but the heart wants what it wants.  

"She's adorned with beauty, grace and charm accompany her face, her words are clothed with wisdom, her zeal for God is manifest in her mission, her voice is contained in shamefaced obedience, and she loves God. Against such qualities it is futile for me to convince myself that an 8 year gap of converging the womb is important."
